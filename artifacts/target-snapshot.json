    {
      "question": "What is the New Pyramid?",
      "answer": "The New Pyramid is a simple guide designed to help Americans eat real, whole foods more consistently. It prioritizes nutrient-dense foods and reduces reliance on highly processed products, using modern nutrition science to support everyday health."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does this matter?",
      "answer": "For the first time, the official guidance from the United States government is to avoid highly processed food. We are not making a legal definition or attacking an industry – we are stating a public health truth that Americans already feel in their bodies and see in their families. These foods include: Packaged, prepared, ready-to-eat, or other foods that are salty or sweet, such as chips, cookies, and candy that have added sugars and salt. Foods and beverages that include artificial flavors, petroleum-based dyes, artificial preservatives, and low-calorie non-nutritive sweeteners. Sugar-sweetened beverages, such as sodas, fruit drinks, and energy drinks Diets dominated by these foods – engineered for shelf life, speed, and addictiveness rather than nourishment – are strongly linked to obesity, Type 2 diabetes, depression, heart disease, certain cancers, and shortened life expectancy. The consumption of these foods is contributing to trillions of dollars per year in healthcare costs. There is no more science-based or urgent public health message than to limit highly processed foods and eat real food. Today, nearly 70% of a American child's diet is defined as ultra-processed – in other countries, this is below 20%. Real food – in it's natural or minimally processed form, supports human health. Highly processed food, consumed at scale and over time, destroys it. The government's message is simple: what we eat shapes how long and how well we live – and choosing real food is one of the most powerful health decisions a person, a family, and a nation can make."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does “Eat Real Food” mean?",
      "answer": "Eating real food means choosing foods that are whole or minimally processed and recognizable as food. These foods are prepared with few ingredients and without added sugars, industrial oils, artificial flavors, or preservatives."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does the New Pyramid emphasize protein and vegetables?",
      "answer": "Protein and vegetables form the foundation of real food meals. Together, they support muscle health, metabolic function, gut health, and stable energy while naturally crowding out highly processed foods."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are fats part of eating real foods?",
      "answer": "Yes. Healthy fats are a natural part of real foods such as meat, seafood, dairy, nuts, olives, and avocados. These fats support brain health, hormone function, and nutrient absorption when consumed in their natural forms."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the New Pyramid address added sugars?",
      "answer": "Added sugars are not part of eating real foods and are not recommended. The New Pyramid encourages avoiding added sugars entirely, especially for children, while allowing naturally occurring sugars found in whole fruits and plain dairy."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where do grains fit in the New Pyramid?",
      "answer": "Grains can be part of a real food diet when eaten in whole or traditionally prepared forms. Foods like oats, rice, and true sourdough are preferred. Refined and packaged grain products should be limited."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about hydration?",
      "answer": "Hydration matters. Choose water or unsweetened beverages to accompany meals and snacks."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the New Pyramid a strict diet?",
      "answer": "No. The New Pyramid is a flexible framework meant to guide better choices, not dictate exact meals. It supports cultural traditions, personal preferences, and different lifestyles while reinforcing one core goal: eat real foods most of the time."
